# Data Analysis Tools Labs

## Project Overview
### This repository contains a collection of labs focused on data analysis and manipulation using Python. The labs cover various topics such as data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), data cleaning, and visualization. The primary tools used include Pandas, SQL, and other Python libraries.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
##### To run the labs, you'll need the following installed on your system:
###### Python 3.x
###### Pip (Python package manager)
###### Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

##### Installing
###### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/shrut-ij/Data-Analysis-Tools.git
```

###### Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd yourrepository
```

###### Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Tests

### Breakdown of Tests
#### Lab 1: Connecting to a MySQL database and querying data. Focuses on fetching data and basic SQL operations.
#### Lab 2: Data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
#### Lab 3: Advanced data manipulation techniques such as concatenation, appending, renaming, and reordering columns.
#### Lab 4: Groupby operations, case statements, and conditional data selection.

#### To run the labs, start the Jupyter Notebook server:
```
jupyter notebook
```
#### Open the notebook files (.ipynb) and run the cells.

## Deployment
#### These labs are intended for local development and learning purposes. No deployment is necessary.
